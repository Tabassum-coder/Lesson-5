            <p>Apples are round, edible fruits that grow on apple trees (Malus domestica). They are one of the most widely cultivated
            tree fruits and the world's fourth most produced fruit, after bananas, oranges, and grapes. Apples are native to Central
            Asia, where their wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, still exists.
            Apples come in many shapes, colors, and flavors, and are high in fiber, vitamin C, and antioxidants. They can be eaten
            fresh, cooked in desserts, or used to make juice or cider. Apples are also filling and low in calories, and may have
            health benefits such as lowering blood sugar and improving heart health. Eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables,
            including apples, may also help reduce the risk of cancer, obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.</p>
